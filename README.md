## For Programmers

If you open the console and call:

**reload()** - It start cycling to all possible texture combinations

**transposeMap()** - It transposes the map. Intended to adapt the map for both horizontal and vertical screens

Navigate to *levelGenerator* folder and call:

```bash
node levelGen.js
```

to generate a new map (saves a *map.json* file in the parent folder)
